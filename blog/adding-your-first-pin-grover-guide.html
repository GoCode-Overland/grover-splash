                <h2>How to Add Your First Pin to Grover</h2>
                
                <p>Ready to share your favorite vanlife spot with the community? Adding your first Grover map pin is easier than setting up camp, and we'll walk you through every step.</p>

                <h3 id="step-1">Step 1: Open Grover</h3>
                
                <p>When you're at a spot you love (or want to remember), here's how to start creating your pin:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Open Grover</strong> and navigate to the map view</li>
                    <li><strong>Tap the camera button in the bottom left of the chat</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Upload an image</strong> so we can capture your coordinates</li>
                    <li><strong>Grover will automatically make a pin for you based on the image</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The beauty of our pin creation system is that it works whether you're currently at the location or adding a spot from memory. We've designed it to be flexible because we know inspiration strikes at different times!</p>

                <h3 id="step-2">Step 2: Upload Your Best Photo</h3>
                
                <p>A great photo makes all the difference in helping others understand why your spot is special. Here's how to add that perfect shot:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tap the camera icon</strong> to add a photo</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose from your gallery</strong> or take a new photo</li>
                    <li><strong>Select your best shot</strong> that captures the essence of the location</li>
                    <li><strong>Add multiple photos</strong> if you want to show different angles or times of day</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>
                
                <p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Photos taken during golden hour or showing your van in the setting help other vanlifers visualize themselves in that space. We love seeing how different rigs look in the same spot!</p>

                <h3 id="step-3">Step 3: Add Essential Details</h3>
                
                <p>Now comes the fun part, telling the story of your spot! This is where you help other vanlifers understand what makes this location special:</p>
                
                <h4>Location Information:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <figcaption style="margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">Be as descript or nondescript as you like, but we find it is more fun when we add our own categories and make the pins engaging!</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <h4>Campsite Details:</h4>
