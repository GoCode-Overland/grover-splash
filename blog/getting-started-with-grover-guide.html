                <h2>Picking Your Rig & Agent</h2>
                
                <p>One of the coolest parts of getting started with Grover is choosing your setup. This helps us tailor your experience to match your specific vanlife style and needs.</p>

                <h3>Selecting Your Rig Type</h3>
                <p>During setup, you'll choose from different van categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sam the Sage:</strong> Goes through the specs of your van one by one so we can build you a custom agent</li>
                    <li><strong>Grover General Travel Planning Only:</strong> Only for planning awesome adventures</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprinter Van:</strong> Mercedes Sprinter-based builds</li>
                    <li><strong>Transit Van:</strong> Ford Transit conversions</li>
                    <li><strong>Promaster Van:</strong> Ram Promaster-based builds or conversions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Don't worry if you're not sure or if you have multiple rigs ‚Äì you can always update this later in your profile settings. However, if you do want an assistant just for your rig we can build you one, just interact with Sam the Sage and we can use those specs and map it to your custom assistant!</p>

                <h3>Choosing Your Agent</h3>
                <p>Your Grover agent is like having a specialized vanlife expert in your pocket. Different agents have different knowledge bases and specialties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Custom agent:</strong> Great for trip planning and specific questions about your systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Travel Planning Agents:</strong> Great for trip planning, maybe you have mastered the systems in your van and don't need help</li>
                    <li><strong>Brand Specific Agent:</strong> Agent for rigs that are produced by manufacturers like AVC Rig, these agents are preset with the components that are common in those van types, ask your manufacturer if they are a partner with Grover</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you can't see your preferred agent options, reach out to us and we'll help you get connected to the right expertise for your needs.</p>
